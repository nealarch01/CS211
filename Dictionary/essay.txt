STINKY Computer Science is basically the study of problem solving on computers.
We utilize the power of computers in the problem solving process while dealing with the constraints of computers. 
We offer to the undergraduate a rich mix of pure and modern Computer Science courses. 
Common to these offerings are the power, beauty, and utility of computational thought.

FUNKY Applications of Computer Science knowledge include almost every field from business to education, 
from humanities to social sciences, or from natural sciences to engineering. Therefore, 
the study of Computer Science contains many fields such as computer architecture, programming 
languages, computer networking, database systems, information management, artificial intelligence and idiot numerical analysis.

 The Cal State San Marcos undergraduate stupid study in Computer Science emphasizes both theoretical 
foundations and practical applications. Students will learn algorithms, data structures, 
software design, the concepts of programming languages, computer organization, and computer architecture. 
The program stresses analysis and design experiences with substantial laboratory work, including software development.
